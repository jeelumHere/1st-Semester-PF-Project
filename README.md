# 1st-Semester-PF-Project
##   **Project Overview**

This project is developed as a Semester Project for the course Programming Fundamentals (PF).
The project is a console-based game application written in C++, designed to demonstrate the practical use of core programming concepts learned during the first semester.

The game allows the user to choose between two different modes:

**Number Game**

**Word Game**

Based on the user’s choice, the corresponding game starts and progresses through increasing difficulty levels.

## **Project Objective**

The main objectives of this project are:

To apply basic Programming Fundamentals concepts in a real project

To improve problem-solving and logical thinking

To practice user interaction using console input/output

To implement control structures, functions, and data handling in C++

## **Game Description**
Game Selection

At the start of the program, the user is asked:

Which game they want to play:

**Number Game**

**Word Game**

Based on the user’s input, the selected game is launched.

## **Number Game**

A sequence of numbers is displayed to the user

The numbers are shown for 5 seconds

After the time delay, the screen clears

The user must enter the exact same numbers

If the input is correct:

The level increases

A new, more difficult sequence is shown

If the input is incorrect:

The game ends

The achieved level is displayed

## **Word Game**

A sequence of words is displayed to the user

The words remain visible for 5 seconds

After the delay, the user is asked to re-enter the words

Correct input:

Advances the user to the next level

Incorrect input:

Ends the game

Displays the final level reached

## **Game Rules**

Each level increases the difficulty

The player must correctly recall the displayed numbers or words

A 5-second time limit is given for memorization

The game continues until the user makes a mistake

## **Programming Concepts Used**

This project demonstrates the use of the following Programming Fundamentals concepts:

Functions – To organize and reuse code

If-Else Statements – For decision making

For Loops – For iteration and level progression

Structures (struct) – For organizing related data

Pointers – For basic memory handling

Arrays – For storing numbers and words

User Input / Output – Using cin and cout

## **Technologies Used**

Language: C++

IDE/Compiler: (e.g., Dev-C++, Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, or GCC)
